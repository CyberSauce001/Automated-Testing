# Automated-Testing


As you know programmers are suppose to be lazy, we will code and find ways for the computer/program/robots/etc to do the work for us. So why not create a program that will do a unit test or an automate test for us, so we don't have to spend hours brute forcing through website or certain technology to see whether or not it is broken everyday. 

This is an automated testing for my company's website to have this program go through and check everything so I do not have to do it every week and focus on other important task at hand.
